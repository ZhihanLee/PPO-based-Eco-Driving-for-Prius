This code established a multi-intersections environment and a simplifed HEV model.

If you never use GYM environment before, you can follow the instruction below:

This code comes from serval iteration, it might set a bad example for writing RL envirnoments. 

So just use it for learning RL in eco-driving.

Thanks @renzong Lian 's code which is a good educational code for me.
